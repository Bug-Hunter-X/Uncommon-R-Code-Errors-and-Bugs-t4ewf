# Uncommon R Code Errors and Bugs

This repository demonstrates some common and uncommon errors that can occur in R code, along with solutions and explanations.  Many R errors are silent or produce cryptic messages, leading to difficult debugging.  These examples highlight those situations. 

**Covered Errors:**

*   Incorrect handling of `NA` values in calculations, particularly the use of `na.rm = TRUE`.
*   Issues with vector indexing and how out-of-bounds indexes are handled (silently).
*   Unexpected behavior from some functions.

The `bug.R` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.R` shows the corrected versions along with explanations.
